This is  a private repository where I’m learning DDD using the book [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecture-patterns-with/9781492052197/) While the book implements examples using Flask API and SQLAlchemy’s ORM features, in my repository, I’m using FastAPI and sqlc, considering current trends. Since sqlc intentionally lacks ORM features, particularly mapping, I’m having difficulty implementing the repository pattern as described in the book.
